<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently a freshman student in FAST University, Karachi, Pakistan. Currently doing Bachelors in Computer Science. During my summer vacations, I decided to utilise my time to learn web development.</br>
  Hence after searching for courses online I can across this course by Ms Angela Yu and have completed the html part of web development.</p>
